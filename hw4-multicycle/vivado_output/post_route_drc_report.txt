PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net mem/mem_reg_1_1_10[0] is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin mem/store_data_to_dmem_reg[7]_i_1/O, cell mem/store_data_to_dmem_reg[7]_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.

Gated clock check  
Net mem/mem_reg_1_1_10[1] is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin mem/store_data_to_dmem_reg[15]_i_2/O, cell mem/store_data_to_dmem_reg[15]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.

PDRC-153#3 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net mem/mem_reg_1_1_10[2] is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin mem/store_data_to_dmem_reg[23]_i_2/O, cell mem/store_data_to_dmem_reg[23]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.

PDRC-153#4 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net mem/mem_reg_1_1_10[3] is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin mem/store_data_to_dmem_reg[31]_i_2/O, cell mem/store_data_to_dmem_reg[31]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
